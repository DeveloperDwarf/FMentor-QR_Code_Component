## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learned how to make a custom card component for a qr-code. In the process I worked some more with flexbox to help centering and aligning the components. I also experimented a bit with the box-shadow css component till I was satisfied with the look.

### Continued development

The next small projects I will work on will also be HTML/CSS beginner Challenges from frontendmentor to become more comfortable with writing HTML/CSS. I especially want to learn more about layout. After I learned more about flexbox and grid and collected more html/css knowledge on the way I will move on to learn Bootstrap as a framework for web development and also tackle javascript.
After learning the basics of those more challenges will follow.
Once I am more confident in my Frontend abilities I will start learning about the Backend. I am in for a long but most likely awesome journey!

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me a lot with understanding the basics of using Flexbox layout. Gonna come back to this one for my next projects aswell till I am really good at using it.
- [MDN Webdocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/CSS) - This one is always great to search for things I dont remember anymore or when I dont know how to use a property. The tutorials are pretty good aswell.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - We know it, we love it. Always helps you out when you get really stuck on a problem and need a hint on how to progress. When you have a problem, somebody probably had it aswell and asked for help on the internet.
